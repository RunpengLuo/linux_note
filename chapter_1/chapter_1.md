## 1. the Big Picture



1. A **Layer** or level is a classification (or group-ing) of a component according to where that component sits between the user and the hardware. Web browsers, games, and such sit at the top layer; at the bottom layer we have the memory in the computer hardwareâ€”the 0s and 1s. The operating system occupies most of the layers in between.

2. Three level in Linux system: User processes, Linux Kernel and Hardware.
